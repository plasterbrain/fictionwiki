- ðŸ’µ [LegendKeeper](https://legendkeeper.com/) - 14-day free trial, regularly $9/month (project owner only, collaborators can access for free). Originally Patreon-funded, launched c. 2020 and is still in open beta. As of 2022 its feature set prioritizes collaboration and interactive maps, with functionality for media embeds and timelines planned.

- https://obsidian.md/ is an extensible, Markdown-based multimedia notebook app. It's more fully-featured than Fictionwiki out of the box but less presentational. The base software is FREE, though publishing your notebook as a website costs $192/year.
